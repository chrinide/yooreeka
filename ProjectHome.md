Dear friends of the Yooreeka project,

As most of you know, the Google Code project hosting site will be closing on January 25, 2016. The sites on Google Code will be read-only on August 24, 2015.

For that reason, we have migrated the public repository on GitHub. If you are new to Yooreeka, please, start from the Github site:

https://github.com/marmanis/yooreeka

If you have the code checked out from the Google Code SVN repository, please, checkout the code from Github. **The SVN repository will no longer be updated with new features, bug fixes, etc.**

The Yooreeka project started with the code of the book "<a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988665/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1933988665&linkCode=as2&tag=magrll05-20'>Algorithms of the Intelligent Web</a><img src='http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=magrll05-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1933988665' alt='' border='0' width='1' height='1' />
" (Manning 2009). Although the term "Web" prevailed in the title, in essence, the algorithms are valuable in any software application.
<br />

An Errata page for the book has been posted <a href='http://www.marmanis.com/static/AIW-Errata/AIW-Errata.html'>here</a>.
<br />
The second major revision of the code (v. 2.x) will introduce some enhancements, some new features, and it will restructure the packages from the root `org.yooreeka.*`
<br />
You can find the Yooreeka 2.0 API (Javadoc) <a href='http://www.marmanis.com/static/javadoc/index.html'>here</a> and you can also visit us at our <a href='https://plus.google.com/104139236480160442995'>Google+</a> home.
<br />
Lastly, Yooreeka 2.0 will be licensed under the Apache License rather than the somewhat more restrictive LGPL.

The library is written 100% in the Java language.
