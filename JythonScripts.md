Translation of the iWeb2 scripts into Jython

Juan Manuel has translated the BeanShell scripts of the book into Jython.

He posted this in the "Issues" tab -- it is [issue 2](https://code.google.com/p/yooreeka/issues/detail?id=2) -- so I will repeat his post here:

I have translated the scripts under Beanshell-Notes into jython and adapted the infrastructure you have created for beanshell to jython. The onlu thing you need to make the code work is to add
jython.jar (you can get it from http://jython.org) to your classpath.

Thanks for the book and code.

Juan Manuel
